August, September and October are the months of kites flying, because the wind blows north-westwards. During
these months, many wonderful kites are flying in the blue sky.
One day as the school was over, Qin Bo, my classmate, called me to accompany him to have kite flying at the big
grass field. I had not flew kite for a long time. So I promised him at last, when I reached there at five, I found him
waiting for me.
Many boys were flying their kites higher in the sky. They were excited when they found their kites win another's.
They shouted with joy and jumped up and down.
Minutes later, Qin Bo's kite was in the sky, but mine was not. I was so disappointed that I wanted to give up. But I
thought how disgraceful I was. So I asked Qin Bo to exchange the kites. Oh! His kite was wonderful. It was so light
that it flew higher than all the other kites. He told me why my kite could not fly because it was made roughly; the head
was heavy, and the end was light. I agreed and made up my mind to make a new kite that would fly high in the sky.我爱你
